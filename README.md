# Dog and Cat Image Classification using CNN
## Project Overview
The Dog and Cat Image Classification project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to effectively classify images into two categories: dogs and cats. This project exemplifies the use of deep learning techniques in computer vision, implementing modern neural network architectures for robust image classification.

## Objectives 
*Model Building:* To construct and train a CNN model capable of distinguishing between dog and cat images.
*Performance Evaluation:* To assess the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
*Reusable Pipeline:* To provide a reusable and scalable pipeline that can be applied to similar image classification tasks.

## Dataset Details
### Source
Kaggle’s Dog vs Cat dataset or an equivalent dataset.

## Structure
Training Images: Labeled images categorized into "dogs" and "cats".
Validation Images: Used for model performance validation.
Testing Images: A separate set of unlabeled images used for final evaluation.

## Preprocessing Steps
Resizing: All images are resized to 256x256 for consistency.
Normalization: Pixel values are normalized to a range of [0, 1] to ensure faster convergence.
Augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and cropping are applied to enhance model generalization.

## Methodology
Data Loading and Preprocessing
Images are loaded using Python libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.
Data Augmentation: The ImageDataGenerator is used to apply data augmentation and reduce overfitting.

## Model Architecture
Input Layer: Accepts images of size 256x256x3.
Convolutional Layers: Extract features using kernels with ReLU activation functions.
Pooling Layers: Max pooling layers reduce dimensionality.
Dropout Layers: Prevent overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers enable high-level reasoning.
Output Layer: Softmax activation for binary classification (dog or cat).
Compilation and Training
Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy is used for classification.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001.
Metrics: Accuracy is used as the primary evaluation metric.
Batch Size: 32, with a total of 10 epochs for training.
Evaluation and Testing
The model is evaluated on the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters.
The testing set is used for the final performance evaluation.
